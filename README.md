**Proud Project/Task:**
I was volunteering at a shelter and was asked to help with assisting the elderly with smart phone usage. It was truly an experience to say the least. They were stunned with the tremendous change in technology from what they had experienced before. It was a joy to get them set up and started on their smart phone devices.
